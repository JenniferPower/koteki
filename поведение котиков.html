      <h2>Behavior and habits of cats</h2>
      <p>All know that cats very independent creations. Still Richard Kipling noticed it
         and correctly defined their living position: "I am a cat, I walk in itself and I do that,
          that I want!" Here with it "I do that there is a wish" constantly owners face
           also do not know how to react to manifestation of features of character of the favourite.</p>
      <h3>The cat gets under feet</h3>
      <img src="images/1(1).jpg" alt="Котик трётся об ноги девушки">
      <p>It seems to you that it interferes with you, and actually, thus the cat expresses to you the
        love and attachment. It is so put in the nature of cat's and other animals that on a smell they
        distinguish personal and others'. When the cat approaches and begins to rub about legs, he simply
        marks you and establishes the right for you for other animals – "Mine! Hands and paws not to
        touch!".</p>
      <h3>The cat bites and scratched</h3>
      <img src="images/1(2).jpg" alt="Котик кусает руку">
      <p>Cat – a predator. And it is never impossible to forget about it. Therefore kittens always play
        hunters. Sexual requirement can become the reason of the raised kusuchesta also. Especially it
        is shown at kittens-boys.</p>
      <h3>The cat tears furniture and wall-paper by claws</h3>
      <img src="images/1(3).jpg" alt="Котик с обоями в зубах">
      <p>Very few people from owners of cats like "terry" sofas and chairs therefore if your cat
        constantly tries to give new shape of upholstered furniture, it is worth undertaking education
        of the favourite. But it is soft and quiet. Cats tear up furniture and wall-paper not because
        they like to bring you to a white knee is the just put program for designation of the
        territory.</p>
      <h3>The cat walks on tables</h3>
      <img src="images/1(4).jpg" alt="Котик на столе">
      <p>First, from the point of view of a cat, he not on tables goes, and inspects the territory.
        Secondly, on tables sometimes something very tasty comes across. Therefore the cat does not
        see the reasons not to go.</p>
      <h3>The cat marks the territory</h3>
      <img src="images/1(5).jpg" alt="Котик метит территорию">
      <p>Often a cat begin to mark the territory that is natural, does not please owners.
        The reason of such behavior lies all in the same place - it is an instinct.</p>
      <h3>The cat constantly asks food</h3>
      <img src="images/1(6).jpg" alt="Котик клянчит еду">
      <p>And this habit entirely merit of owners. Once once the pity gives in, at the sight of
        mournful expression of a muzzle – and all. Cats very clever animals are also able to
        manipulate with dexterity of the diplomaed psychotherapist.</p>
      <h3>The cat brings you "presents"</h3>
      <img src="images/1(7).jpg" alt="Котик с мёртвой мышкой в зубах">
      <p>Cats like to bring to owners of dead mice, birds, lizards and insects. Even after
        "Is not present," pets will continue to present thanks you. It is absolutely normal,
        this manifestation of care and love. From where to a cat know what people do not eat dead
        rodents and bugs?</p>
      <h3>The cat rumples something by pads</h3>
      <img src="images/1(8).jpg" alt="Котик мнёт попу лапками">
      <p>Cats like to climb up knees and to massage to favourite owners of a leg. Such behavior – a
        strong indication of trust. The cat shows that he feels in safety that to it it is cozy
        and quiet. Such behavior is put in the pet since the childhood when he, being a little
        kitten, with love massed tiny pads a soft fluffy stomach of mother cat, regaling on a
        tasty milk.</p>
